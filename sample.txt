Climate Change and Ocean Ecosystems

The world's oceans are experiencing significant changes due to climate change. Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea level rise are affecting marine ecosystems in profound ways.

Key impacts include:
- Coral bleaching events becoming more frequent and severe
- Changes in fish migration patterns and breeding cycles
- Ocean acidification affecting shellfish and plankton
- Sea level rise threatening coastal habitats

Research shows that these changes are occurring faster than initially predicted, requiring urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect marine biodiversity.

The scientific community has documented these changes through extensive monitoring programs and satellite observations, providing clear evidence of the need for immediate climate action.
